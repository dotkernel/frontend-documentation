# Dependency Injection

Dependency injection is a design pattern used in software development to implement inversion of control. In simpler
terms, it's the act of providing dependencies for an object during instantiation.

In PHP, dependency injection can be implemented in various ways, including through constructor injection, setter
injection and property injection.

DotKernel API, through its [dot-dependency-injection](https://github.com/dotkernel/dot-dependency-injection) package
focuses only on constructor injection.

## Usage

**DotKernel API** comes out of the box with the
[dot-dependency-injection](https://github.com/dotkernel/dot-dependency-injection) package, which provides all we need for
injecting dependencies into any object you want.

`dot-dependency-injection` determines the dependencies by looking at the `#[Inject]` attribute, added to the constructor
of a class. Dependencies are specified as separate parameters of the `#[Inject]` attribute.

For our example we will inject `UserService` and `config` dependencies into a `UseHandler`.

```php
use Dot\DependencyInjection\Attribute\Inject;

class UserHandler implements RequestHandlerInterface
{
    #[Inject(
        UserService::class,
        "config",
    )]
    public function __construct(
        protected UserServiceInterface $userService,
        protected array $config,
    ) {
    }
}
```

> If your class needs the value of a specific configuration key, you can specify the path using dot notation:
> `config.example`

The next step is to register the class in the `ConfigProvider` under `factories` using
`Dot\DependencyInjection\Factory\AttributedServiceFactory::class`

```php
public function getDependencies(): array
{
    return [
        'factories' => [
            UserHandler::class => AttributedServiceFactory::class
        ]
    ];
}
```

That's it. When your object is instantiated from the container, it will automatically have its
dependencies resolved.

> Dependencies injection is available to any object within DotKernel API. For example, you can inject dependencies in a
> service, a handler and so on, simply by registering it in the `ConfigProvider`.
