# Creating migrations

Migrations are used to create and/or edit the database structure.
To generate a new migration file, use this command:

```shell
php vendor/bin/doctrine-migrations migrations:generate
```

It creates a PHP file like this one `/data/doctrine/migrations/Version20220606131835.php` that can then be edited in the IDE.
You can add new queries in:

- `public function up` - these are executed when the migration is run.
- `public function down` - these are optional queries that undo the above changes.

## Example

This example creates a new column named `test`.
Add this in `public function up`:

```shell
$this->addSql('ALTER TABLE users ADD test VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL');
```

And its opposite in `public function down`:

```shell
$this->addSql('ALTER TABLE users DROP test');
```
