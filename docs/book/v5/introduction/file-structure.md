# File structure

Dotkernel Frontend follows the [PSR-4](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/) standards.

It is considered good practice to standardize the file structure of projects.

When using Dotkernel Frontend the following structure is installed by default:

![Dotkernel Frontend File Structure!](https://docs.dotkernel.org/img/frontend/file-structure-dk-frontend.png)

## Main directories

* `bin` - Executable files from CLI
* `config` - Various configuration files
* `data` - Should contain project-related data (AVOID storing sensitive data on VCS)
* `log` - Storage of log files generated by dot-error-log library
* `public` - Publicly visible files. The webserver need to have this folder as www-document root folder.
* `src` - Should contain the source code files
* `test` - Should contain the test files

## Special purpose folders

* `.github`  - Contains workflow files
* `.laminas-ci` - Contains laminas-ci workflow files

## `src` directory

This directory contains all source code related to the Module.
It should contain the following directories, if they are not empty:

* Handler - Action classes (similar to Controllers but can only perform one action)
* Entity - Database entities
* Service - Service classes
* Collection - Database entities collections
* Repository - Entity repository folder

> The above example lists just a part of the directories in a project, but it should give you an idea of what the structure should look like.

Other classes in the `src` directory may include `InputFilter`, `EventListener`, `Helper`, `Command`, `Factory` etc.

The `src` directory should also contain 2 files:

* `ConfigProvider.php` - Provides configuration data
* `RoutesDelegator.php` - Module main routes entry file

## `templates` directory for modules

This directory contains the template files, used for example to help render e-mail templates.

> Dotkernel Frontend uses `twig` as Templating Engine.
> All template files have the extension `.html.twig`.

## `data` directory

This directory contains project-related data, like cache and file uploads.

We recommend using the following directory structure:

* `data/cache` - Location where caches are stored
* `data/doctrine` - Fixtures and migrations
* `data/lock` - Lock files generated by [dotkernel/dot-cli](https://docs.dotkernel.org/dot-cli/v3/lock-files/)
