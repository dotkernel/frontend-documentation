# NPM Commands

To install dependencies into the `node_modules` directory run this command.

```shell
npm install
```

> If `npm install` fails, this could be caused by user permissions of npm.
> The recommended way to install npm is through `Node Version Manager`.

The watch command compiles the components then monitors the files for changes and recompiles them.

```shell
npm run watch
```  

After all updates are done, this command compiles the assets locally, minifies them and makes them ready for production.

```shell
npm run prod
```
